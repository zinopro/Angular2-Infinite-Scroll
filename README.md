Code Overview

The code listens for scroll events and triggers a data load when the user scrolls a certain distance (160 pixels) from the last recorded position.

The listenToScroll method creates an observable from the scroll events and processes them as follows:

    Throttling: Limits the rate at which scroll events are processed using throttleTime(100), which ensures events are handled no more than once every 100 milliseconds.
    Filtering: Uses a filter to determine if the scroll position has moved past a threshold (160 pixels). If it has, the event is emitted.
    Subscription: When the filtered scroll event is emitted, the loadData function is called to handle the data loading.

Why RxJS 5.x?
This example uses RxJS 5.x to demonstrate handling of observable events without the pipe method, which is introduced in RxJS 6.x. This is useful for legacy applications or specific use cases requiring RxJS 5.x.

The captureKeys method is used to manage a list of keys, ensuring that they are processed in batches and the total number of captured keys doesn't exceed a specified size.
